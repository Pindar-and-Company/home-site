      content: `In today's digital landscape, organizations are discovering that data can be both an asset and a significant liability. While data drives innovation and business intelligence, it also creates compliance burdens, security risks, and operational overhead that can impact the bottom line.

      The regulatory environment has fundamentally changed how we think about data stewardship. GDPR, CCPA, and emerging privacy laws worldwide have transformed data from a "collect everything" mindset to a more strategic approach focused on purpose limitation and data minimization.
      
Organizations must now consider the total cost of data ownership, including storage, security, compliance monitoring, and the potential costs of breaches or regulatory violations. This paradigm shift requires new frameworks for data governance and risk assessment.
      
Key strategies for managing data as a liability include implementing data retention policies, conducting regular data audits, and establishing clear data ownership and accountability structures. Organizations that proactively address these challenges will find themselves better positioned to leverage data as a strategic asset while minimizing associated risks.
      
The future of data management lies in finding the right balance between data utility and data responsibility. This requires not just technical solutions, but also cultural changes in how organizations think about data collection, storage, and use.`
